# Consider a module to be the same as a code library.

# A file containing a set of functions you want to include in your application.

# To create a module just save the code you want in a file with the file extension .py:

# Now we can use the module we just created, by using the import statement:



def greet():
    x = str(input('Enter your name to continue : '))
    print("Hiee " , x)
